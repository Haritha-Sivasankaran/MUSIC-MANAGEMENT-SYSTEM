#                     MUSIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

The goal of this project Music Management System is to make the user happily listen to the songs with all the comfortable features in one site. This application will store the information of customers, artists, songs, albums, movies, etc. The application is built for users to search songs and albums based on various search parameters. Upon searching for a song the user will be provided with a non-audio-based output such as artist name, album name, movie name, song length, and other details. In some of the pre-existing systems, the database is maintained by the users, which results in unverified information being added to the database, thus giving scope for errors. For these systems, the problem was tackled by giving all the privileges to the admin for maintaining the database in place of users. Although, implementing this solution solves the previous problems, but created a new problem where the database didn’t get updated regularly. To overcome this challenge, our application consists of an admin-user coexistence where the user can suggest new songs and albums which can be updated in the database upon verification by the admin. The admin manages all the entries including customer details and can block a customer in case of any suspicious activity.
